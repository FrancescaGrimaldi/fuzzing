# Fuzzing with Address Sanitizer
This repository contains the source code of the 5th assignment of the "Security in programming and cryptography" course held at NTNU (Fall 2023 semester).

# Tasks
1. Perform fuzzing with _address sanitizer_ on the C function created for Assignment 4b
2. Fix bugs found through fuzzing
3. Set up a CI (Continuous Integration) solution that performs fuzzing with _address sanitizer_
4. Create tests, and run tests as well in CI

# Documentation
The report with the instructions executed to perform fuzzing and details on the set up of the CI solution with GitHub actions can be found [here](https://github.com/FrancescaGrimaldi/security-and-cryptography-assignments).
